This is simple Climate App build using Vue.js

Climate App is a view to check some weather forecasting in different 5 days 
in some specific city.

This app didn't test in local machine, because it have been developed in
JS Bin website.

So just open this URL instead http://jsbin.com/ceguxil/1/edit?html,css,js,output
